      <p>The Cross River gorilla is a Critically Endangered subspecies of the western gorilla. It was named a new species in 1904 by Paul Matschie, a mammalian taxonomist working at the Humboldt University Zoological Museum in Berlin, but its populations were not systematically surveyed until 1987.</h4>
  <p>  Cross River gorillas are forest dwelling creatures. They mostly live in highland forests. In the Cross River region, the forests are tropical and subtropical. The gorillas can sometimes be found in lowland forests, but they tend to stay at higher altitudes.</h4>
  <li>They live in cameron</li>
  <li>also Nigeria,</li>
  <li>Lifespan in the wild is 35 to 50 years.</li>
  <ol><li>they are most likely to go extinct by 2045</li>

  <p>The Cross River gorilla is usually found in montane rainforest between 1,500 and 3,500 meters and in bamboo forest from about 2,500 to 3,000 meters.
</p><p>The Cross River gorilla is restricted to a small area of highland forest on the border of Cameroon and Nigeria.</p><p>This restricted distribution to highland areas is likely a consequence of human hunting pressure and competition over habitat, which is more intense in lowland areas.</p>
